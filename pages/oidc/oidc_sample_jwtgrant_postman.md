description: Using Postman with Maskinporten JWT-grants
summary: "This is short how-to on using Postman towards APIs secured by Maskinporten, including Difis self-service APIs.  A small standalone tool is used to generate the JWT-grant and exchange it for an access token.  This access token is then used as a bearer token in Postman."
